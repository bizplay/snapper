Snapper
=======

## Reason for this extension
When using Chrome to show digital signage content it is important that Chrome does not get stuck on the "Aw snap" error page. Since Chrome runs continuously hours on end for this purpose the chance of an "Aw snap" error is real.

## How Snapper works
This Chrome extension will reload a tab that runs into an "Aw snap" error automatically, minimizing any interruption of the digital signage content.
