Snapper
=================

When using Chrome to run Digital Signage it is important that Chrome does not show the "Aw snap" page. Because of the time Chrome runs continuously in case of Digital Signage the change of an "Aw snap" is real.

This Chrome extension will reload a page that runs into an "Aw snap" automatically making the interruption of the Digital Signage content as small as possible.
